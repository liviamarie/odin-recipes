# odin-recipes

This is my very first project in The Odin Project program!

I will be creating a recipe website that will include several links to recipes.  At this time the website will be pretty basic, only including HTML with the intention of styling it with CSS later down the line.  

I will be deomonstrating my current HTML skills, and am excited to elaborate on this project as I move through The Odin Project curriculum.
