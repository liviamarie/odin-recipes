            Hamburger Helper Beef Stroganoff</a></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup yellow onion, finely diced</li>
        <li>1 lb ground beef, 85% lean</li>
        <li>1 cup mushrooms, sliced thin</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp onion powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tsp dijon mustard</li>
        <li>4 cups wide egg noodles, uncooked</li>
        <li>4 cups beef broth</li>
        <li>2 tbsp white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>8 oz light sour cream </li>
        <li>2-3 sprigs of fresh thyme, leaves only, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat with olive oil. Add the onions and cook, stirring, for 2 to 3
            minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef. Brown the beef, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt and pepper. Cook, breaking
            up the meat with the back of a spoon, until no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>If you feel like there is too much excess fat, drain off but reserve about 2 tablespoons of the fat to saute
            the mushrooms in.</li>
        <li>Add the dijon mustard and mushrooms and cook, stirring, until well-combined and when the mushrooms have
            soaked up some of the excess fat and are softened, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Then, add the uncooked wide egg noodles, beef broth and white wine vinegar. Bring to a boil and cook,
            stirring often, until noodles are tender and liquid has been absorbed, about 12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove skillet from heat and stir in the sour cream.</li>
        <li>Taste and add more salt, if desired. Garnish with thyme, serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
